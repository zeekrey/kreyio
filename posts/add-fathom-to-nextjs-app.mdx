title: Add Fathom to your Next.js App
description: I used Google Analytics for almost forever. But since GDPR requires you to add a notfication if you use cookies I switched to Fathom. Here is how to add it to a Next.js app.

While the official installation process at [usefathom.com](https://usefathom.com/ref/Q0QUXX) references a blog post by [Vercel](https://vercel.com/guides/deploying-nextjs-using-fathom-analytics-with-vercel) which describes the required steps pretty good, I sill had to add some thoughts myself. Here are things I'm going to cover in this post:

- Install the fathom-client
- Store the tracking identifier in an environment variable

## Install the fathom-client

First, you need to log into or signup at [usefathom.com](https://usefathom.com/ref/Q0QUXX) and create a site. After this you need to add a script tag to your website or you use a client library instead. I would recommend the following library: [fathom-client](https://github.com/derrickreimer/fathom-client).

```bash
yarn add fathom-client
```

This lib provides three functions:

- [load()](https://github.com/derrickreimer/fathom-client#loadsiteid-string-opts-object) - Injects the Fathom script into the DOM and lets you set some config
- [trackPageview()](https://github.com/derrickreimer/fathom-client#trackpageviewopts-object) - Tracks a page view
- [trackGoal()](https://github.com/derrickreimer/fathom-client#trackgoalcode-string-cents-number) - Tracks custom goals

All this needs to be implemented in a custom `_app.js` file like so:

```javascript
//within pages/_app.js
import { useRouter } from "next/router";
import { useEffect } from "react";
import * as Fathom from "fathom-client";

function App({ Component, pageProps }) {

  //...

  const router = useRouter();

  useEffect(() => {
    Fathom.load("your-tracking-id", {
      // Including domains is optional, but I would recommend it as it will only count page views and events on this domains. Dev environments will be excluded with this config.
      includedDomains: ["yourdomain.com"],
    });

    function onRouteChangeComplete() {
      Fathom.trackPageview();
    }
    // Record a pageview when route changes
    router.events.on("routeChangeComplete", onRouteChangeComplete);

    // Unassign event listener
    return () => {
      router.events.off("routeChangeComplete", onRouteChangeComplete);
    };
  }, [router.events]);

  //...
```

## Store the tracking identifier in a environment variable

It's really not a good idea to store your keys (even if they are no secrets) within your source code. To store them within the environment here is what you need to do:

```javascript
//within pages/_app.js
import { useRouter } from "next/router";
import { useEffect } from "react";
import * as Fathom from "fathom-client";

function App({ Component, pageProps }) {

  //...

  const router = useRouter();

  useEffect(() => {
    // Test if the fathom key is available within process.env
     if (process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FATHOM) {
       // !!! Don't forget the NEXT_PUBLIC_* since only this will make the variable available to your frontend
        Fathom.load(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FATHOM, {
          includedDomains: ["yourdomain.com"],
        });
      } else {
        // If it is not available, print a message.
        console.warn("Tried to load Fathom but no key was provided.");
      }

    function onRouteChangeComplete() {
      Fathom.trackPageview();
    }
    // Record a pageview when route changes
    router.events.on("routeChangeComplete", onRouteChangeComplete);

    // Unassign event listener
    return () => {
      router.events.off("routeChangeComplete", onRouteChangeComplete);
    };
  }, [router.events]);

  //...
```

If you want to track goals, like newsletter signups or checkouts call the [trackGoal()](https://github.com/derrickreimer/fathom-client#trackgoalcode-string-cents-number) function whereever you like.

While it should [not be required](https://usefathom.com/compliance) to add a annoying cookie notice when using Fathom, you probably should update your privacy policy text on your website. Fathom has a nice [little snippet](https://usefathom.com/docs/legal/privacy-policy-sample) which can be easily added to your website.
