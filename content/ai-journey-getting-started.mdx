Artificial intelligence is here! Well, it’s not exactly new, but until today, I’ve mostly been a spectator of this exciting movement. While I’ve been quite certain that this will shape our future, I never really took the plunge myself. Recently, the Deepseek R1 was officially released on January 20, 2025. I’ve heard that it’s open source and can compete with the current best-in-class (closed source) solutions like OpenAI's o1. That’s a great reason for me to dive in.

The following text and all blog posts tagged with "AI Journey" will serve as a sort of journal to document my exploration of AI solutions. Just a quick disclaimer: I’m a software developer focusing on the frontend aspect. I’m not a mathematician or a machine learning expert, so my exploration will be more about using existing AIs rather than delving deeply into how to create such AIs.

### Let's just run this...

I want to run this Deepseek thing on my own hardware. Here the repository: https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1. Mh, there is no actual source. The is a PDF file with 22 pages, some figures a license and a readme. As I'm going through the readme, I unfortunatly notice that there are to many word I don't know yet. I need to figure them out.

#### What is a large language model LLM?

First of all, it says a LLM is a type of artificial intelligence model to understand and generate human-like text.
