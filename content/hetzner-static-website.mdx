Hetzner is a German hosting provider that offers a free tier for static websites. This is a great option for hosting small projects or personal websites. In this post, I will show you how to deploy a static website to Hetzner.

## Create a Hetzner account

To get started, you need to create a Hetzner account. You can sign up for a free account [here](https://www.hetzner.com/). Once you have created an account, you will need to verify your email address.

## Create a new project

Once you have verified your email address, it somewhat cumbersome to order the actual product. Just go to the [Webhosting site](https://www.hetzner.com/de/webhosting/) and select level 1 to start with. They will then ask you a bunch of questions. As far as I could see, a de domain is basically for free - all other domains will be payed. You could also transfer in an existing domain or apply nameservers.

## Create a new static website

Now let's create the actual website. Let's asume you've created your wesbite using [v0.dev](https://v0.dev/). On the top right corner, you will see an export button. Click it and select "Download ZIP". This will download a not just the website, but instead a complete [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project.

Unzip the folder and open it in your favorite code editor.

> Now you'll need a bunch of tools to get started. I won't cover this here. What you basically neeed is [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and a common understanding arround Node packageme management (NPM) and its ecosystem.

Nextjs and React and somehow raw building blocks for modern website. You can't just deploy this somewhere and expect it to work. You need to build the project first - basically converting all this wired stuff in HTML, CSS and JS. This is done by running a build in command. But before we can do this, we need to adjust a setting.

Normally Nextjs comes with a bunch of really sophisticated features. But for a static website, we don't need all this. So let's adjust the `next.config.ts` file. Open it and add the following lines:

```javascript
const nextConfig = {
  output: "export",
}
module.exports = nextConfig
```

This will tell Next.js to build the project as a static website.

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a new folder called `out` in the root of your project. This folder contains all the static files for your website.

## Deploy your website

Now lets go back to hetzner, open the projact we just created and search for the webFTP section. Open a FTP session and then open the `public_html` folder. Remove everything that is in there and copy the content of the `out` folder into the `public_html` folder. This is it. You can now open your website in a browser.

> For SSL was not working at this moment. The Hetzner console says it will take a few minutes. I guess this is because the domain is not yet verified. I will update this post once I know more.
