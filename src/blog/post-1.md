Well just gimme something without any sugar in it, okay? You heard her she said get your meat hooks, off, uh please. Oh, uh, hey you, get your damn hands off her. Do you really think I oughta swear? Get your meat hooks off of me. You know Marty, I'm gonna be very sad to see you go. You've really mad a difference in my life, you've given me something to shoot for. Just knowing, that I'm gonna be around to se 1985, that I'm gonna succeed in this. That I'm gonna have a chance to travel through time. It's going to be really hard waiting 30 years before I could talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.

Safe now, everything's let lined. Don't you lose those tapes now, we'll need a record. Wup, wup, I almost forgot my luggage. Who knows if they've got cotton underwear in the future. I'm allergic to all synthetics. Right, and where am I gonna be? Yeah. Marty, why are you so nervous? Re-elect Mayor Goldie Wilson. Progress is his middle name.

Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm going back in that zoot suit? The old man really came through it worked. 1955? You're my ma- you're my ma. Hey, hey listen guys. Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay? Right, okay, so right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me. That's right, twenty five years into the future. I've always dreamed on seeing the future, looking beyond my years, seeing the progress of mankind. I'll also be able to see who wins the next twenty-five world series.
