You okay, is everything alright? Now, now, Biff, now, I never noticed any blindspot before when I would drive it. Hi, son. Really. Give me a hand, Lorenzo. Ow, dammit, man, I sliced my hand. Who are you?

Good, you could start by sweeping the floor. And where's my reports? You got a real attitude problem, McFly. You're a slacker. You remind me of you father when he went her, he was a slacker too. oh yeah, all you gotta do is go over there and ask her. I hope so.

Ahh. Yeah, I guessed you're a sailor, aren't you, that's why you wear that life preserver. Oh, yeah, yeah. Well, what if they didn't like them, what if they told me I was no good. I guess that would be pretty hard for somebody to understand. What, what, ma?
