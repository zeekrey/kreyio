## Lessens Learned

What did you learn doing this project? Feel free to list multiple things. Also feel free to
cover non-technical lessons. It’s great to talk about how you learned to use an
advanced feature of a framework or library, but it’s just as valuable to talk about
project-management experience, or things you learned about shipping projects.

If you used a framework or other libraries/tools, was it a good choice? How did it
help? In which ways was it insufficient?

How has this affected the work you’ve done since then? Real examples of how this
project built your knowledge for future projects is fantastic.
